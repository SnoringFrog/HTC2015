# HTC2015
Collection of poetry (and probably a bit of prose eventually). Unconventional use for Github, I'm sure, but I wanted it both backed up and easily accessible. Many of these will be extremely rough pieces, potentially not even finished, so sorry for any poor quality perusing these may subject you to.

This is my attempt at the [Hundred Theme Challenge](http://100themeschallenge.deviantart.com/blog/33698704/) for 2015.

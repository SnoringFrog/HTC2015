There’s little left of me that sees this goal in reach
When something fickle as the weather, takes all the rest from me
So this little bit of progress, feels much more like consolation
Not a triumph, not a return; not an aptly bled creation

Read it one way, read it [two|too]
It will all mean something else to you
Could it ever matter what I mean
When it’s your thoughts that bring the therapy?

But here again–a shift
(A disguise for the rust,
A panting, rife with lust)
Leaves style and point adrift

Perhaps this seems a struggle
To move from one life to another
Or maybe within these words you see
A faint reflection of a deeper me

I find only fading bloodlines here, nearly gone
Running dry like an old river, that the Founder has forgot
Yet this little bit of liquid, feels much more like an ocean
Not a gravestone, not a mem’ry; not a pining recollection

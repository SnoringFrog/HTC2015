That girl over there just shot someone.
Walked right up to him, put a gun to his head, and paused:
"What are you doing? Think about this!"
He pleaded.
"I have thought about this--for a long time,
And I've realized that this is everything I want,"
And she pulled the trigger.

I call that girl "friend".
While everyone denounces her,
Cries out for her punishment--
Death penalty, imprisonment, justice--
I call her "friend",
Not out of some prior obligation to maintain some relationship
(I never knew her before the gunshot),
But because right now, in this moment,
As the weight of a life settles on her,
In this moment, when she has stepped away as a member of compliant humanity,
In this moment, when humanity has rushed in for her blood, for justice
(Justice that will come in its due time),

She has never needed friendship more.

Forward two and a half
Yet down thirteen besides
Weird how it works that way.

Not that it's new
Just a new phrase to the cycle
At least to me.

But the point
To it, yes
Can't say I care enough about "right" to make this that anymore
But, well, oh well

Moving on.
(In a way that's what this isn't)

Ever had those questions asked
That you give answer for just fine
Then spend two and a half (so far) still wondering
What your answer really is?

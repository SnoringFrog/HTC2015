The things that make me say
"I want to be a one that way"
Are the ones not like the ones the ones I like are like
The ones I like are like 
Beauty in chance meetings
Kept of out the rain while the clothes are made
The ones I like are like 
Order around a, shift 
- lowercase (no stops) the words fit
The ones I like are like 
Nothing real,
Or at worst not yet
Or at worst di-ffer-ent
The ones I like are like this
The ones I like are like this [k]not
At all

The ones I like are like 
the ones I like are like
One and all

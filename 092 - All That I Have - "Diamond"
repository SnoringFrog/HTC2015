You value me too highly
You, who's made me your idol
For something I did, or do
Something I accomplished, something I gained--
It's all less than you think.

You value me too highly
You, who's never heard my name
Or my voice, or even seen my face
You've never had a thought I was part of or privy too--
I'm still less than you think

What value I have?
Here, I'll show you:
(Just know this price comes with an asterisk)
*scatters change across the floor*
That number's all too high
A single coin would be excessive
And the rest are solely for effect
To cause enough clatter for any who can't see
To cause clatter with as much worth as me
Or maybe more

I've taken this noose from my neck
And the knife from my back
But these weights on my ankles
Still drag me to the depths

Every inch here is hell
Every foot here is death
I could undo these chains
If not for the gun to my head

[full, non-musical scream]
Demons let me go
There is no part of me you have a right to
Death--release your cold grip on my throat

[quietly]
Unless...
Unless leaving me would set your sights on a friend
On someone I love
Then please, by all means
Never leave my side
And never let me go

Let me hold their hell
